         <em>Street photography and 35mm film have become a big part of my life. As a photographer, I find myself captivated by the way these elements converge, forcing me to pause, observe, and see things differently. Unlike the instant gratification of digital photography, shooting with 35mm film makes me cherish the art of waiting for the perfect moment, capturing raw emotions that make a photograph truly powerful.</em>
